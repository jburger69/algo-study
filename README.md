# algo-study

Here is a repo of all the algos I currently worked on or am working on. I try to do atleast 1 hour of algo study a day.
I keep the algos in a repo so when I need a refresher I can come back to them.

# Installation

1.) Clone repo into directory

2.) CD into cloned directory

3.) Run node.js <nameOfFile> to see output of algo in console
